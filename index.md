## Introduction

Falkland CMS is a Curation Management System used to collect, curate, organize and present the knowledge that exists in the world about a particular topic.

### Why use Falkland CMS?

Like its inspiration, [Omeka](http://omeka.org/about/), Falkland CMS sits at the intersection between a traditional Web CMS, a Digital Collection Management system, and a Museum Exhibit Management system. Unlike Omeka, Falkland CMS is written in Clojure, ClojureScript and CouchDB and has a certain elegance and panache.

Ideal uses:

* a repository of digital collections
* online presentation of library collections
* online museum exhibits

These are perfect fits for Falkland CMS:

* The Venerable VIC-20 - an online exhibit of everything Commodore VIC-20
* Camus.org - a primary and secondary source collection for the philosopher Albert Camus
* Mudskippers.org - a guide to all the world's knowledge about the amazing amphibious fish
* Jack Freeman's Library - presenting 40 years of one man's books
* nil.org - a complete guide to nihilism 
* 8-bit '80's - a site to exhibit an extensive retro video game collection
* The Pitiful Pirates - a history of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1976-1995

### Who is this for?

Falkland CMS is for anyone who wants to collect, curate, organize and present the knowledge that exists in the world about a particular topic:

* scholars and professors
* teachers and students
* museum and exhibit curators
* librarians and archivists
* historical organizations
* collectors, hobbyists and enthusiasts

### Who is this not for?

Falkland CMS is not for everyone, if these describe you, you should probably look elsewhere:

* You that needs extensive new content authoring
* You need extensive, professional-grade offline artifact cataloging
* You need granular security

### Who is using Falkland CMS?

Falkland CMS was created to support [Falklandsophile](http://falklandsophile.com), the complete guide to resources about the Falkland Islands. This is where the name for Falkland CMS came from.

### How is Falkland CMS Different than a Content Management System?

A traditional CMS or [WCMS (web content management system)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system) is a system for publishing website content. Key features of a WCMS are:

* separation of content and presentation
* easy editing of content, usually through an administrative web UI
* collaboration of multiple content authors
* templates to take the data in the system and present it as web content, typically HTML

Falkland CMS has these foundational capabilities, but is not focused on the creation of *new* content. Instead, Falkland CMS is used for collecting, curating, organizing and presenting existing content.

Falkland CMS does support authoring new content, but this new content is intended to provide context for the presentation and exhibition of collected resources. You wouldn't run a daily newspaper with Falklankd CMS.

Because of this difference of focus, the acronym that is used for Falkland CMS is Curation Management System.

## Quick-Start on Heroku

Quick start instructions for Heroku are expected by the end of November 2013.

## Local Installation

Most of Falkland's dependencies are internal, meaning Leiningen will handle getting them for you. There are a few exceptions:

* [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - a Java 7 JRE is needed to run Clojure
* [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) - Clojure's build and package management tool
* [CouchDB](http://http://couchdb.apache.org/) - CouchDB is a schema-free, document-oriented database, ideally suited for a CMS
* [elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) - elasticsearch is a schema-free, document-oriented search engine, ideally suited for CouchDB

Detailed instructions for local installation are expected by the end of November 2013.

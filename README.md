Falkland CMS is a Curation Management System used to collect, organize, curate and present the knowledge that exists in the world about a particular topic.

![FCMS Key Concepts](http://falkland-cms.com/assets/img/FCMS-High-level.png "FCMS Key Concepts")

Anything that can be unambiguously referenced with a unique identifier such as an [ISBN/ISSN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number), DOI ([Digital Object Identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)), PURL ([Persistent URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_uniform_resource_locator)) or URL ([Uniform Resource Locator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator)) can be curated with Falkland CMS. The curation process consists of adding metadata information about an item that makes it easier to collect, organize, search, present and exhibit.

Items can be physical things: books, magazines, newspapers, documents, papers, consumer products, artifacts, animals, buildings, people, etc. Or items can be digital or abstract: web pages, articles, chapters, images, audio files, video files, web sites, databases, directories, words, concepts, topics, etc.

Falkland CMS can be used to describe relationships among items and can assist in the archiving and preservation of digital items.

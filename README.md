### What's a Curation Management System?

A traditonal CMS or [WCMS (web content management system)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system) is a system for publishing website content. Key features of a WCMS are:

* separation of content and presentation
* easy editing of content, usually through an administrative web UI
* collaboration of multiple content authors
* templates to take the data in the system and present it as web content, typically HTML

Falkland CMS has these foundational capabilities, but is not focused on the creation of *new* content. Instead, Falkland CMS is used for collecting, curating and exhibiting existing content.

Because of this difference of focus, the acronym that is used for Falkland CMS is Curation Management System.

### Why use Falkland CMS?

Like its inspiration, [Omeka](http://omeka.org/about/), Falkland CMS sits at the intersection between a traditional Web CMS, a Digital Collection Management system, and a Museum Exhibit Management system.

Falklands CMS is for collecting and curating, not authoring. While Falkland CMS supports authoring of new content, this new content is intended to provide context for the presentation and exhibition of collected resources. Falkland CMS is not intended as a WCMS for a huge corpus of brand new content. You wouldn't run a daily newspaper with Falklankds CMS. Its primary role is to point to existing content, either content on the web, or content collected into Falklands CMS.

Ideal uses:

* a repository of digital collections
* online presentation of library collections
* online museum exhibits

### Who is this for?

* scholars
* museum and exhibit curators
* librarians
* archivists
* historical organizations
* teachers and professors
* collectors / hobbyists / enthusiasts

### Who is this not for?

* Anyone that needs extensive new content authoring
* Anyone that needs extensive, professional-grade offline artifact cataloging
* Anyone that needs granular [security](#security)

### What are some (hypothetical) example uses of Falkland CMS?

* The Venerable VIC-20 - an online exhibit of everything Commodore VIC-20
* Camus.org - a primary and secondary source collection for the philosopher Albert Camus
* Mudskippers.org - a guide to all the world's knowledge about the amazing amphibious fish
* Jack Freeman's Library - presenting 40 years of one man's books
* nil.org - a complete guide to Nihilism 
* 8-bit '80's - a site to exhibit an extensive retro video game collection
* The Pitiful Pirates - a history of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1976-1995

### What are some (real) example uses of Falkland CMS?

* [Falklandsophile](http://falklandsophile.com) - the complete guide to resources about the Falkland Islands

### Where'd the name came from?

Falkland CMS was built to support the [Falklandsophile](http://falklandsophile.com) website. So the name seemed fitting.

## STATUS

Falkland CMS is pre-alpha and not yet usable. A usable version is expected by the end of October 2013.

## INSTALLATION

## Quick Start - Heroku

Falkland CMS is pre-alpha and not yet usable. A usable version is expected by the end of October 2013 and quick start instructions for Heroku will be available then.

## Local Installation

Most of Falkland's dependencies are internal, meaning Leiningen will handle getting them for you. There are a few exceptions:

* [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - a Java 7 JRE is needed to run Clojure
* [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) - Clojure's build and package management tool
* [CouchDB](http://http://couchdb.apache.org/) - CouchDB is a schema-free, document-oriented database, ideally suited for a CMS
* [elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) - elasticsearch is a schema-free, document-oriented search engine, ideally suited for CouchDB

Falkland CMS is pre-alpha and not yet usable. A usable version is expected by the end of October 2013 and detailed instructions for local installation will be available then.

## KEY CONCEPTS

### Collections
A Falkland CMS instance support one or more collections of items. A collection is all the items that you'd like to be organized and searched on together. Taxonomical organization and searches don't span multiple collections so usually you'll have just one collection or each collection will support a website or app for experiencing the collection. There may be cases where you have multiple websites or apps supported by the same collection or one website or app accessing multiple collections, but these would be less typical.

### Items
Items are referential in nature. They act as a catolog entry for something: a web page, a book, a product, a person, an animal, a building. The possibilities are endless and simply depend on what it is you are trying to curate.

### Taxonomies
A taxonomy is a particular classification scheme for organizing items into hierarchical categories. Central to Falkland CMS is supporting multiple independant taxonomies. Most collections will have many different taxonomies to categorize their items by different criteria. 

### Faceted Search / Navigation

[Faceted search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search) or faceted navigation is full-text search blended with navigation by multiple, orthogonal filters. It's possible with faceted search for example to do a full text search on "Camus" with "BBC" as the creator and limit the search to the "online video" media taxonomy, the "United States" geography taxonomy. Faceted search and navigation is a powerful technique for quickly exploring a large catalog of items.

### Pages

There are 3 types of pages:

* **item** - an item page displays a single particular item from the collection.
* **taxonomy** - a taxonomy page page displays a list of items in a particular category of a particular taxonomy.
* **exhibit** - An exhibit page may reference many named or searched for resources, but could also be made up of just static content. A home page is a good example of a dynamic exhibit page, and an about page, or terms of use page is a good example of a completely static exhibit page.

### <a name="security"/> Security Model

Users of Falkland CMS are one of three types:

* **Administrator** - named users that can administer the configuration of the system and all items.
* **User** - named users that can create, update, and delete all items in the system, but not administer the configuration of the system.
* **The General Public** - everyone accessing the system anonymously with their web browser.

## DEVELOPMENT AND CONTRIBUTING

Please fork Falkland CMS on GitHub if you'd like to enhance it. Submit your pull requests if you'd like to contribute back your enhancements. I promise to look at every pull request and incorporate it, or at least provide feedback on why if I won't.

## GETTING HELP

Falkland CMS is pre-alpha and not yet usable. A usable version is expected by the end of October 2013 and instructions for getting help will be available then.

## Why Falkland CMS?

### Who is this for?

### Who is this not for?

* Anyone that needs granular [security](#security)

### Where'd the name came from?

Falkland CMS was built to support the [Falklandsophile](http://falklandsophile.com) website. So the name seemed fitting.

## Installation

### External Dependencies

Most of Falkland's dependencies are internal, meaning lein will handle getting them for you. There are a few exceptions:

* [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) - Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the Java VM
* [Java](http://www.java.com/) - a Java VM is needed to run Clojure
* [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) - Clojure's native build tool
* [CouchDB](http://http://couchdb.apache.org/) - CouchDB is a schema-free, document-oriented database, ideally suited for a CMS
* [elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) - elasticsearch is a schema-free, document-oriented search engine, ideally suited for CouchDB
